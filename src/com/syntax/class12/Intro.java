	 * OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
	 * 	Object oriented programming is just a way of writing code
	 * and classes and objects are the basic parts of this method.
	 * 
	 * Why we should learn the OOP?
	 * 	1) Because OOP simplifies the development of programs.
	 * 	2) It makes it easy to manage and maintain large programs.
	 * 	3) OOP is built around object classes and many other things
	 * which can help us to translate real life objects into computers.
	 * 
	 * How to write programs using OOP?
	 * 	1) Create classes and inside these classes define properties/fields/
	 * attributes to translate how an object from real life looks like
	 * 	2) Create methods/behaviors/functions to define how that thing works
	 * in real life.
	 *
	 *Note:
	 *	OOP is also supported in many other programming languages like
	 *C#, PHP, Python, Javascript, etc. Other than OOP, we also have
	 *different paradigm or ways of writing code functional programming
	 *is one of it. We also have procedural programming.
	 *
	 *How do we create a class and its object?
	 *		-->(Below things are called as attributes/properties/fields)
	 *		class Human{	-->(NOTE:Class names are always upper case)
	 *		String name;
	 *		char gender;
	 *		int age;
	 *		double weight;
	 *		
	 *		-->(Below things are called as methods/functions/behaviors/matter)
	 *		void walk(){
	 *		}
	 *		void talk(){
	 *		}
	 *	}
	 *-->(All above code template is defined as Class)
	 *
	 *	In Java, its convention to call the attributes as fields and
	 *call the behaviors as methods.
	 *
	 *RULES:
	 *	1) We can define the fields and methods anywhere in the class code body.
	 *The sequence of execution don't matter.
	 *	2) The sequence of execution only matters when we are inside a method.
	 *
	 *String is the most widely used class in Java.
	 *
